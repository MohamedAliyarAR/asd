# gitignore
This is used  to ignore the large files while pushing the file to repo on github many of them forgets the format and to add gitignore this a simple template where you can copy
and paste it in your gitignore file .The file should be exactly as **.gitignore** using this is a best practice  :blush: .<br /><br />
I use this  extension provided by vscode that generates the gitignore refer this link to [download](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piotrpalarz.vscode-gitignore-generator).After installation  copy this ```Generate .gitignore File``` then use this following command
```cntrl+shift+p``` and  paste in that text bar

.<br /><br />For other SDE users they can use this [online gitignore generator](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore)<br />
